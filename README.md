## About

Full Stack Developer specializing in React, Node.js, TypeScript, Next.js, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and REST API design. Currently building the **AI-VIBE-ECOSYSTEM v2.0** — a multi-product, agent-driven developer platform.

---

## 🏗️ What I’m Building

I am architecting **AI-VIBE-ECOSYSTEM v2.0**, a human-first developer platform where agents don't just write code—they collaborate within a unified system architecture. This ecosystem exists to bridge the gap between high-level intent and production-grade execution by treating AI as a first-class citizen in the developer's toolkit. This portfolio represents the **Fullstack lens** into that system, focusing on the end-to-end integration of agentic workflows.

---

## 🧩 The AI-VIBE Products (Fullstack Focus)

While the ecosystem spans 5 products, my work here focuses on the conversational and builder interfaces:

- **AI-VIBE-ChatWeb**: The primary entry point for human-agent collaboration. I focus on real-time streaming, context management, and intuitive UX for complex intent.
- **AI-VIBE-WebBuilder**: Our generative site architect. I work on the bridge between agent-generated components and production-grade design systems.
- **AI-VIBE-CLI**: The terminal interface for power users, ensuring parity with the web experience and robust background execution.
- *Integrations*: Deeply connected with **Automation** for background sync and **VSCode** for the ultimate IDE-to-Web workflow.

---

## ⚙️ How This Portfolio Fits the Ecosystem

This portfolio demonstrates the **Integration & Scalability** layer of the AI-VIBE-ECOSYSTEM. It showcases how we build full-stack interfaces that handle high-complexity agent interactions without sacrificing performance. It aligns with the **ChatWeb → Builder → CLI** workflow, where a conversation in the browser leads to a generated app and eventual terminal management.

---

## 🤖 Agents & Workflows I Use

In building this ecosystem, I leverage specialized agent workflows:
- **Planner & Code Reviewer**: Ensuring that every full-stack feature is architected for scalability and security before PR.
- **TDD Guide**: Driving our backend logic through test-driven development to ensure agent stability.
- **Architect**: Mapping out the complex state machines required for multi-product synchronization.

---

## 💎 Design & Quality Principles

- **Human-First Development**: AI should reduce friction, not add complexity to the human experience.
- **Security by Default**: Strict RLS, auth boundaries, and agent audit trails.
- **Progressive Complexity**: Fast initial onboarding that scales to complex enterprise patterns.
- **Tradeoffs Accepted**: Choosing React/Vite for this portfolio ensures a responsive, logic-heavy interface that mimics the complexity of our production systems.

## Additional Features (vNext)

Five focused enhancements aligned with full-stack development:

### Keyboard Shortcuts
**Why added:** Terminal users expect keyboard-first navigation. Clicking through sections feels wrong in a CLI-themed portfolio.

**What changed:** Press 1-7 to jump directly to sections (Hero, Identity, Systems, Modules, Capabilities, Data Log, Establish Uplink). Press `?` to see all shortcuts in a modal. Skips when you're typing in the search box.

### Sidebar State Persistence
**Why added:** If I prefer the sidebar collapsed, I shouldn't have to re-collapse it on every visit.

**What changed:** Sidebar open/closed state persists in localStorage. Remembers your preference across sessions. On mobile, it still auto-collapses (that's just good UX).

### Case Study Project Cards
**Why added:** Full-stack work is about solving problems, not just using tech. Recruiters want to see how I think through challenges.

**What changed:** Click any project card to expand and reveal Problem → Solution → Outcome structure. Shows the thinking behind each build, not just the React/Node/Postgres stack. GitHub metrics (stars/forks) displayed on each card.

### Skills by Proficiency Level
**Why added:** "I know React" is vague. "I'm expert at React, learning Prisma" is honest and helps match me to the right role.

**What changed:** Skills section now has two views: BY_PROFICIENCY (default) shows Expert/Proficient/Learning groupings. BY_CATEGORY shows original functional groupings. Toggle between them with one click.

### Project Search
**Why added:** With 60+ projects, scrolling to find the right one is frustrating. Search is expected UX.

**What changed:** Real-time search filters projects by name or tech stack. Shows "X/Y modules found" count. Smooth AnimatePresence transitions.

### Intentionally Rejected: Command Palette
I considered adding a VS Code-style command palette (Cmd+K). Rejected because it's overkill for a single-page portfolio. The 1-7 shortcuts are faster for regular use, and `?` handles discovery. A command palette would add complexity without meaningful benefit—this is a portfolio, not an IDE.
